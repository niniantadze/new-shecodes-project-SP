      <h1>What is so special about Sylvia Plath?!</h1>
      <p>
        Sylvia Plath | Biography, Poems, Books, Death, & Facts ... Why is Sylvia
        Plath important? Sylvia Plath was an American writer whose best-known
        works, including the poems “Daddy” and “Lady Lazarus” and the novel The
        Bell Jar, starkly express a sense of alienation and self-destruction
        that has resonated with many readers since the mid-20th century.
